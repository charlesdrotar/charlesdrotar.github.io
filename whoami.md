![Work](assets/img/microsoft.png) Work

I am currently a Senior Software Engineer at **Microsoft** working on an *Azure IoT SaaS solution* for brick-and-mortar stores. Before that I worked as a data engineer for various product teams within Microsoft's Augmented Reality flagship product - the Hololens.

Prior to Microsoft, I worked at **Capital One** as a data engineer where I helped automate data science workflows in *AWS* using *Spark, Python, R, Airflow, Ansible*, and various other analytical tools. I won the Chairman and President's award within my first year of being hired based on the impact I had on the Data Science community within Capital One. This is awarded to less than 1% of the engineers each year.

Before Capital One, I worked at **AT&T** as a big data engineer. It was here that I learned to become proficient with *Hive, Pig,* and the *Hadoop* ecosystem in general. 

It was just prior to this where my career started as an algorithms and software engineer for **Raytheon's Intelligence, Information, and Services (IIS)** division. It was there I obtained a *top secret clearance*, learned about *natural language processing (NLP)*, and *swarm intelligence* paradigms.

## Personal History

Issaquah, Washington is home. My work and studies have taken me from the Dallas Fort-Worth Metroplex to the state of Washington. My travels have taken me to Kosovo, Albania, Turkey, Japan, Australia, and the Dominican Republic.

Since coming to Washington I have started training for half-marathons. I completed my first half marathon (virtually) on April 28, 2021. I intend to do the Seattle Half-Marathon in November 28, 2021.
