# Overview

Unity breaks its training regiment into pathways. 
The way Unity does this is by offering 2 pathways - *Unity Essentials* and *Junior Programmer*.
*Unity Essentials* is a 2 week course that targets beginners like myself.
The objective of that pathway is to learn the major areas of the Unity by creating simple games.
Along the way you learn scripting, creating 2D and 3D worlds and how to apply audio to your Unity project.

This blog covers the Unity Essentials Pathway. It is broken down into 3 Missions and is primarily focused for new users to Unity:

1. [x] **Foundations: Get Started with Unity** - Learn the basic controls and vocabulary while publishing a forked version of a ready-made game. 
2. [ ] **Foundations: Explore Unity** - Learn the basics of 2D and 3D realtime scene generation, scripting objects, and adding audio.
3. [ ] **Foundations: Learn Unity** - A mission focused on how to pursue the next steps of the learning process in the Unity journey.
    
## Missions

### Foundations: Get Started with Unity

This mission focused more on the user primarily getting used to some elementary concepts 
and vocabulary, than the user mastering a particular area and creating something truly unique.

I found this mission to be a gentle introduction into the Unity ecosystem. 
Upon completion of the mission, I installed Unity, created an FPS game from a template, 
and made slight modifications to it before publishing to the Unity Play ecosystem. 

What I found most interesting about the process was how focused the learning was 
and how well paced it was. For someone who has very uncertain footing in the 3D and 2D
world development and overall game development space, I was able to understand 3D
scene generation and the roll of assets. 
It also piqued my curiosity about the role of scripting.

One interesting aspect of the training was that it was very heavy in motivational videos 
from current Unity users. I found it to be a very empathic approach to the learner. 
Overall I found this mission to be the exact amount of complexity I needed to feel 
encouraged and challenged to continue.
