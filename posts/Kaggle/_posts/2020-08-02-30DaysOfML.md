# Overview

I joined [this 30-day challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/thirty-days-of-ml) to have a nice daily refresher of basic ML concepts,
and to finally join the Kaggle community. Looking forward to sharing 
my experience.

# Day 1 - 08/02/2021: Level up to Contributor

Today's challenge was very simple. It consisted of using a dummy 
notebook and adding some code snippets to build a simple Random Forest
classifier model to predict whether an individual would survive the titanic
based on simple features. This is the quintessential Kaggle example
that everyone refers to. Interestingly enough, women
survived at a rate of 74%, whereas men only survived at a rate of 19%. 
It does beg the question, why the disparity? 

As part of the daily challenge, I submitted the predictions from the Random
Forest classifier, posted a comment, and gave an upvote to another 
individual's post. The objective was to raise my ranking from Novice 
to Contributor status. Overall, the initial challenge was pretty easy.

# Day 2 - 08/03/2021: Hello, Python

Today's challenge was very easy. 
It was basic arithmetic operators and order of operations in python.
I like the simplicity of it. 
I could see being able to understand it easily even if I was not fluent in python.
It was nice how it covered little tricks like the in-place swapping `b, a = a, b`.

# Day 3 - 08/04/2021: Functions and Getting Help

Another simple challenge. The idea of this
exercise was to learn the anatomy of a function and
how to use `help()` to learn more. 

I did learn that  `round()` can round to a negative number of decimal places (i.e. integer place).
What that means essentially is for each value that is negative we round to the `10*n`th place.
So if the value is `-1`, we round to the tens place. If it is -3, we round to the thousands place.

```python
# Will yield 0 because 10 rounded to the hundreds is 0.
round(10, -2)
```

# Day 4 - 08/05/2021: Booleans and Conditionals 

This challenge got a little more interesting. 
They structured the examples for conditional evaluation as word problems and
ask you to identify the errors based on the scenario you are trying to solve.
For example there are a set of 4 conditionals associated with if you should take an umbrella,
but given the order of operations and lack of parentheses it evaluates incorrectly.

The concepts that were introduced were simple. There was a few examples where I solved things in a different fashion:

```python
def sign(num):
    """
    This function returns 1 if positive, -1 if negative and 0 if 0
    """
    if num == 0:
        return num
    return num / abs(num)
```

vs. the solution:

```python
def sign(x):
    if x > 0:
        return 1
    elif x < 0:
        return -1
    else:
        return 0
```

...and an interesting blackjack simulator to determine if you as a player should hit. The objective is to beat the dealer in 50000 simulated games.
I chose to experimentally derive rules instead of research well-formed strategy online. I marginally improved over the basic strategy of never hitting.
Surprisingly you can win ~38% of your games if you never hit. My simplistic strategy improves upon it by a little over 3.5%.

I think given more time I would explore more strategies to improve probabilities given the number of aces.
Interestingly you don't get to have any knowledge of the dealer's showing cards to inform your strategy.

Overall this was an enjoyable lesson.
